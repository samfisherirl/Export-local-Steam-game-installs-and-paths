# All-in-one-tool to export steam libraries, no coding or compiling. 
VDF Parser in python (and compiled release with .exe) 
Thank you to @Grub4K at https://github.com/Grub4K/VDFparse/releases
He's done most of the work. I'm just bridging the gap from json to human speak, merging libraries and validating paths. 

need to add requirements and more details but this is done with: 

-python 3.10 

need to remove duplicates, it does identify correct paths with some missing. Registry search being added.

-update: it currently includes duplicates but this will be fixed, along with better matching 12/24/22
